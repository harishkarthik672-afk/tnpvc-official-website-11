            <p>In the growing landscape of Tamil Nadu’s small towns, where dusty roads meet rising dreams, one name
                steadily became a pillar of transformation — <strong>R. Srinivasan</strong>.</p>
            <p>He was not born into wealth. There was no inheritance of business empires, no corporate backing, no grand
                office in the beginning. What he had was belief — belief in people, belief in villages, and belief that
                dignity should not depend on a city pin code.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="map-pin"></i> A Dream That Started on Nanguvakamam Road</h2>
            <p>In the busy stretch of Kali Pambalayam near Nanguvakamam Road, Srinivasan stood beside his close
                associate Rajamanickam Asariya one evening. They watched workers return home, families sit outside
                half-finished houses, and small shops close their shutters.</p>
            <p>That evening, Srinivasan asked a simple but powerful question:</p>
            <blockquote>“Why should modern interiors belong only to cities? Why not our villages? Why not our people?”
            </blockquote>
            <p>That question became the foundation stone of <strong>TNPVC Interiors</strong>.</p>

        <section class="story-section animate">
            <h2><i data-lucide="smartphone"></i> The Humble Beginning</h2>
            <p>There was no showroom. No grand launch. No advertisement banners.</p>
            <p>Only a mobile phone. Only WhatsApp. Only courage.</p>
            <p>Through simple videos and design samples shared over mobile, Srinivasan and his team began offering PVC
                ceilings and interior transformations to homes across Kali, Pambalayam, Pulachi, Situr, and even towards
                Kerala border areas.</p>
            <p>People were skeptical at first. PVC was new. Interiors were considered luxury. But Srinivasan believed:
            </p>
            <blockquote>“Interior is not about luxury. It is about self-respect.”</blockquote>
            <p>Every small home was treated like a palace. Every shop like a branded showroom. Every project like a
                promise.</p>

        <section class="story-section animate">
            <h2><i data-lucide="activity"></i> The Struggles That Built the Strength</h2>
            <p>There were days without payments. There were nights filled with doubt. There were competitors who mocked
                the idea of building “city-style” interiors in villages.</p>
            <p>But during one Ramzan season, Srinivasan completed an urgent overnight project so a family could
                celebrate in a beautifully finished home. That single act changed everything. Word spread across
                WhatsApp groups. Calls increased. Trust grew.</p>
            <p>Soon people began saying: <strong>“If you want your home transformed, call TNPVC.”</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="story-section animate">
            <h2><i data-lucide="shield-check"></i> More Than Interiors – A Broader Vision</h2>
            <p>As TNPVC grew, Srinivasan met professionals connected with LIC, Galaxy Health Insurance, and IRM groups.
                He understood something deeper:</p>
            <p>A home needs beauty. But a family needs security.</p>
            <p>So he began guiding families not only in interiors but also towards financial awareness and protection.
                His vision expanded from ceilings to stability.</p>

            <h2><i data-lucide="award"></i> A Promise to Carpenters’ Daughters</h2>
            <p>But the most important chapter of Srinivasan’s life was not about PVC. It was about people.</p>
            <p>He had seen something closely. The carpenters working under TNPVC — skilled men who shaped ceilings and
                structures — often struggled to provide higher education or stable futures for their daughters.</p>
            <p>That is when Srinivasan made a life-changing decision. He announced:</p>
            <blockquote>“Every carpenter who builds TNPVC’s dream will see his daughter build her own dream.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>He introduced a <strong>lifetime job opportunity promise</strong> for the daughters of carpenters working
                with TNPVC. He began offering them roles in:</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 3rem;">This decision transformed TNPVC from a business into a movement. Families that
                once saw construction work as a daily wage job now saw it as a gateway to generational upliftment.</p>

        <section class="story-section animate">
            <h2><i data-lucide="maximize"></i> The Grand Expansion</h2>
            <p>With leaders like Amit Palar, Purvi, Rajamanickam Asariya, and technical craftsmen like Arigala Nehamam
                contributing their expertise, TNPVC Interiors grew into a recognized name across Tamil Nadu’s smaller
                towns.</p>
            <p>From simple PVC square ceilings to mega, modern interior transformations; from one mobile phone to a
                connected operational network — TNPVC became more than a brand. It became a symbol.</p>

        <section class="story-section animate">
            <h2><i data-lucide="star"></i> The Legacy of Srinivasan</h2>
            <p>Today, when people speak about TNPVC Interiors, they don’t just talk about ceilings or designs. They talk
                about village empowerment, employment for women, dignity for workers, and security for families.</p>
            <blockquote>Big cities don’t create big dreams. Big courage does.</blockquote>
            <p>R. Srinivasan proved that impact rises one ceiling and one future at a time.</p>
