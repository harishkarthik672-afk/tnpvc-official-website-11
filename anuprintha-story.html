            <h2><i data-lucide="map-pin"></i> From the Heart of Trichy</h2>
            <p>Every story has a beginning, and for <strong>Anuprintha S</strong>, it started in the culturally rich
                city of <strong>Trichy</strong>. While many come to the interior design industry through books and
                degrees, Anuprintha’s connection was far more personal—it was in her blood.</p>
            <p>Her parents were not owners of large firms; they were the real hands that built the industry. Both her
                <strong>mother and father</strong> worked as dedicated labor professionals in the interior trade,
                creating beauty for others through their own hard work. They didn't have their own business, but they
                had a mastery over the craft that few can claim.

            <h2><i data-lucide="home"></i> A Family of Craftsmen</h2>
            <p>Growing up, Anuprintha was surrounded by the language of construction and design. Her home was a living
                classroom. This legacy of craftsmanship didn't stop with her parents—her <strong>brother</strong> also
                found his calling in the industry, specializing in intricate <strong>glass work</strong>.</p>
            <p>Seeing her family transform raw materials into beautiful home interiors every day sparked a deep-rooted
                interest in the field. She understood early on that interior work isn't just about profiles or sheets;
                it’s about the people who put them together with integrity.</p>
            <blockquote>"I saw my parents and my brother work with such dedication. For me, entering the interior
                industry wasn't a choice—it was a natural extension of who I am."</blockquote>

            <h2><i data-lucide="graduation-cap"></i> Turning Passion into Professionalism</h2>
            <p>While she had the field knowledge, Anuprintha knew she wanted to bring a new level of management and
                precision to the family trade. She excelled in her studies, scoring <strong>80% in SSLC</strong> and
                <strong>72% in HSC</strong> in Coimbatore. She then moved on to the prestigious <strong>Kongunadu Arts
                    and Science College</strong>, where she earned her <strong>BBA CA (Bachelor of Business
                    Administration with Computer Applications)</strong> in 2022, graduating with an outstanding
                <strong>82%</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>She didn't stop at a degree. She sharpened her technical edge with certifications in <strong>Accounting,
                    Banking, and Tally Prime 5.0 & ERP 9</strong>. This rare combination of ground-level understanding
                and high-level management expertise made her the perfect fit for leading operations at TNPVC Council.

            <h2><i data-lucide="heart"></i> Life, Love, and Legacy</h2>
            <p>Beyond her professional achievements, Anuprintha’s life is anchored by a beautiful family. She has been
                happily <strong>married for 3 years</strong> to <strong>Subash</strong>, a professional who holds a
                B.Com CA degree. Together, they are embarking on one of life’s most beautiful journeys—raising their
                <strong>1.5-year-old baby</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Her family’s long history in the interior trade remains her greatest inspiration. She carries their work
                ethic into every project she manages at TNPVC Council, ensuring that every worker is respected and every
                client’s dream is realized with the same care her parents gave to their work.</p>
